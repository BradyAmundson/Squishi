	<welcome>
		<p>
			Welcome to Squishi, a coding language based off of all of our favorite emojis and motivated by efficiency and simplicity.
		</p>
	</welcome>
	<p>Squishi is a coding language that was created with the goal of being simpler, cleaner, and more visually intuitive than other programming languages. One of the key priorities of Squishi is to use concise syntax, which means that the language is designed to be easy to read and write. Additionally, Squishi aims to make advanced programming features such as list comprehension and class merging more accessible to programmers of all levels.
	</p>
	</n>
	<p>
	One unique aspect of Squishi is the use of emojis in the language. We, the creators of Squishi believe that pictures are worth a thousand words, and so they have implemented emojis into the language as a way of making the purpose of each function more understandable. This approach can be particularly helpful for those who are just starting to explore programming, as it provides a more visual learning tool.
	</p>
	</n>
	<p>
	For example, the ðŸ«³ emoji may be used to represent a list or an array, while the ðŸŽ¤ emoji could represent a function that has something to do with audio or sound. By using emojis in this way, Squishi aims to make programming more intuitive and less intimidating for beginners, while also making it more expressive and enjoyable for experienced programmers.
